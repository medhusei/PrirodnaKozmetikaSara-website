Natural Cosmetics Website

This is a multi-page website created for a fictional natural cosmetics brand.  
The project was built using only HTML and CSS, with a focus on clean structure and responsive design.
The goal of this project was to practice building a complete multi-page website from scratch using only HTML and CSS.  
It includes several pages such as Home, About, Products, and Contact.  
The design emphasizes natural aesthetics, simplicity, and user-friendly navigation.
This was the first project I built independently at the beginning of my self-learning journey, with the goal of strengthening my understanding of web structure and layout.
